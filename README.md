# 💥 Analyzing Economic Crises Across Africa (1870–2014)
# 🧠 Overview

This project explores the history and patterns of economic crises across African countries from 1870 to 2014, focusing on banking, currency, inflation, and systemic crises.

Using data from the African Crises Dataset, the analysis investigates how these events correlate with macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, exchange rates, and inflation, providing insights into Africa’s financial resilience and vulnerability.

# 🎯 Objectives

To identify trends in economic crises across African nations and time periods.

To examine the correlation between crisis occurrences and key macroeconomic indicators.

To apply regression analysis to estimate the likelihood of a crisis given specific economic conditions.

To visualize patterns of crises through SQL queries, and Tableau dashboards.

# 📦 Data Sources

African Crises Dataset (1870–2014) — compiled from historical financial data in Kaggle Website.
