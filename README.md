# 💥 Analyzing African Debt Trends and Financial Crises (2000–2024)
# 🧠 Overview

This project examines government debt issuance trends across all 54 African countries from 2000 to 2024, with a focus on the post-2015 surge in domestic borrowing and its links to historical financial crises(1870-2014). Using the African Debt Database from the Kiel Institute as the core dataset, we extend analysis from the classic African Crises Dataset(Reinhart and Rogoff-inspired) to explore how rising debt correlates with risks of banking, currency, infalation and currency crises.

# 🎯 Objectives

To identify debt issuance patterns(total, domestic/external) across countries and years.

Correlate debt trends with crisis indicators i.e inflation rates and debt defaults from historical data

To apply SQL aggregations to prepare regression-ready datasets.

To visualize patterns and trends through Tableau dashboards.
# 📦 Data Sources

African Crises Dataset (1870–2014) — compiled from historical financial data in Kaggle Website.
