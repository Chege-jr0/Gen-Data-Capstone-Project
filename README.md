# 💥 Analyzing African Debt Trends and Financial Crises (2000–2024)
# 🧠 Overview

This project examines government debt issuance trends across all 54 African countries from 2000 to 2024, with a focus on the post-2015 surge in domestic borrowing and its links to historical financial crises(1870-2014). Using the African Debt Database from the Kiel Institute as the core dataset, we extend analysis from the classic African Crises Dataset(Reinhart and Rogoff-inspired) to explore how rising debt correlates with risks of banking, currency, infalation and currency crises.

# 🎯 Objectives

To identify debt issuance patterns(total, domestic/external) across countries and years.

Correlate debt trends with crisis indicators i.e inflation rates and debt defaults from historical data

To apply SQL aggregations to visualize charts.

To visualize patterns and trends through Tableau dashboards.
